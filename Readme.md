# Paneer 🍲

A framework to build desktop applications using web technologies and Python 🐍.

Uses the internal webview to render UI and python for the logic layer. Currently in **very very** early stages of development.

> basically plans to be [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) but for Python with much less features and much less stability!
