# Paneer 🍲

A framework to build desktop applications using web technologies and Python 🐍.

Uses the internal webview to render UI and python for the logic layer. Currently in **very very** early stages of development.

## Quick Start

1. **Install**
   ```bash
   pip install paneer
   ```

2. **Create a project**
   ```bash
   paneer create
   ```

3. **Run in development**
   ```bash
   paneer run
   ```

4. **Build for release**
   ```bash
   paneer build
   ```

> basically plans to be [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) but for Python with much less features and much less stability!
